3DPrinter:
    Name: 3D printer
    Description: >
        A machine capable of turning g-code and plastic filament into objects
        For printing Polypropylene it should be able to have a nozzle that heats up to ~230C
        and a heated bed that reaches 100C.

CentralPCB:
    Name: central printed circuit board
    Description: >
        The central printed circuit board is the board that containst the electronic components controlling power distribution, interaction with a microcontroller and computer, and generation of the control signal to the spike and hold boards. These boards can be ordered from many different suppliers, and the necessary files to do so are present here: https://github.com/BeeHive-org/BeeHive/tree/master/hardware/hub_PCB_redesign

SHPCB:
    Name: Spike and Hold printed circuit boards
    Description: >
        The spike and hold printed circuit boards are used to place all electronic components responsible for getting a control signal and translating that into opening and closing each solenoid valve. These boards can be ordered from many different suppliers, and the necessary files to do so are present here: https://github.com/BeeHive-org/BeeHive/tree/master/hardware/spike_n_hold

SolenoidValves:
    Name: Mini solenoid Valves
    Description: >
        The solenoid valves are 2 way valves that control the direction of air flow. For low time latencies in delivering odours, 
        we are using small valves that have a fast response time (<2ms) in opening and closing. Their small size and small head space
        also helps with the delivery of short, time precise pulses.

PrintedBlock:
    Name: 3D printed central block
    Description: >
        The central block is a 3D printed block (for this project we are using Polypropylene) where solenoid valves 
        and air lines cab be fixated. It has a central chamber where the air coming from different lines can be mixed.
        The flow of each line into the block's central chamber is controlled by the opening or closure of one solenoid valve.
