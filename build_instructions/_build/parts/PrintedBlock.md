# 3D printed central block

The central block is a 3D printed block (for this project we are using Polypropylene) where solenoid valves  and air lines cab be fixated. It has a central chamber where the air coming from different lines can be mixed. The flow of each line into the block's central chamber is controlled by the opening or closure of one solenoid valve.
