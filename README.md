# Olfactometer

Olfactometer to present odour to flies in a controlled and precise manner. 

Based on the work presented [here](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/47/16925) and [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004218300646).


The authors of the papers above have some documentation on [github already](https://github.com/grg2rsr/OlfactoryStimulator), unfortunately some of the schematics are only in PDF format (which prevents fast conversion to PCBs) and some of the CAD files are in a proprietary format, that officially can only be read with "Autodesk Inventor". Luckly there is a plugin for FreeCad that allows the conversion to a more open format https://github.com/grg2rsr/OlfactoryStimulator
