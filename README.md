Olfactometer to present odour to flies in a controlled and precise manner.  




Based on the work presented [here](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/47/16925), [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004218300646) and [here](<https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/42/2/141/2709444>)

The authors of the papers above have some documentation on [github already](https://github.com/grg2rsr/OlfactoryStimulator), unfortunately some of the schematics are only in PDF format (which prevents fast conversion to PCBs) and some of the CAD files are in a proprietary format, that officially can only be read with "Autodesk Inventor". Luckily there is a [plugin for FreeCad](https://github.com/jmplonka/InventorLoader/) that allows the conversion to a more open format.  

Since it would be quite expensive to reproduce the PEEK machined part they describe on the paper, we sorted polypropylene filament and we are printing the part. Several online resources show tips and guides on how to print with this material:
