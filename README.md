The authors of the papers above have some documentation on [github already](https://github.com/grg2rsr/OlfactoryStimulator), unfortunately some of the schematics are only in PDF format (which prevents fast conversion to PCBs) and some of the CAD files are in a proprietary format, that officially can only be read with "Autodesk Inventor". Luckily there is a [plugin for FreeCad](https://github.com/jmplonka/InventorLoader/) that allows the conversion to a more open format.
